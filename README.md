👋 Hello, I’m Recep Şenel (RedzepTech)

Digital Incident Analysis & Evidence-Oriented Security Engineer

I work at the intersection of:

Digital incident analysis

Evidence integrity thinking

Information security awareness

Digital risk & human behavior patterns

Over 30+ years of experience in public-sector IT environments.
I focus on extracting meaningful insights from complexity.

🧠 Analytical Philosophy

Digital phenomena are rarely random — they are outcomes of:

System interactions

Process flaws

Behavioral triggers

Data traces & signals

I approach each incident with an evidence-first mindset rather than assumptions.

🔍 Core Expertise

Digital incident & forensic-aware analysis

Log correlation & event timeline building

Behavior-driven risk pattern identification

Process security & root cause reasoning

Data protection (KVKK / GDPR context)

Visibility of evidence and traceable data flows

🛠 Technical Eyes on

I think in terms of:

Observe → Correlate → Interpret → Validate → Document


This is how I safely dissect technical reality.
