> "Digital events are rarely random. They are outcomes of systems, processes, and human decisions interacting over time."

# 👋 Hello, I'm Recep Şenel (RedzepTech)

**Digital Incident Analysis | Evidence-Oriented Security | Process & Behavior Driven Thinking**

30+ years in public-sector IT environments.  
I analyze digital events not as isolated technical issues, but as **intersections of systems, processes, human behavior, and data traces**.

---

## 🧠 Analytical Approach

I focus on understanding:

- **How an event emerged**
- **How it evolved across systems**
- **Which traces it left behind**
- **Why it happened**
- **How it can be prevented**

I work with evidence-oriented reasoning rather than assumptions.

## 🔍 Core Technical Focus

- Digital incident analysis methodologies  
- Log correlation & event timeline reconstruction  
- Digital evidence integrity principles  
- System & process failure analysis  
- Behavior-driven risk patterns  
- Data flow traceability  
- Pre-incident risk indicators  

---

## 🛠 Technical Toolkit

**Systems**  
Linux • Windows • Networked infrastructures  

**Analysis**  
Log analysis • Event correlation • Timeline reconstruction  
Root cause analysis • System behavior interpretation  

**Security Context**  
Process-driven security gaps  
Data protection awareness (KVKK / GDPR perspective)  
Evidence preservation discipline  

---

## ⚙️ Working Philosophy

Observe → Correlate → Interpret → Validate → Document


---

## 🚀 Featured Projects

- **PhishLens TR** — Social engineering pattern analyzer  
- **Incident Log Parser** — Structured log review toolkit  
- **Evidence Trace Toolkit** — Event trace comparison utilities  

---

## 🧩 What Differentiates My Work

I do not stop at surface symptoms.  
Unresolved issues remain under analysis until the root cause is understood.

## ⚠️ Professional Scope

This profile reflects a **consultative analytical perspective**.  
It does not constitute legal representation or formal expert witness services.

## 🚧 Currently Exploring

- Behavior-driven risk indicators in digital environments  
- Log correlation patterns for incident reconstruction  
- Process-originated security weaknesses  
- Evidence integrity awareness in system operations  
- Human factor influence in digital incident timelines
