## 🔎 Start Here

I investigate real incidents and reconstruct what actually happened inside systems using logs and digital traces.

➡️ **Primary project:**  
**LogWatch-TR — Windows Event Log (EVTX) investigation & triage tool**  
https://github.com/redzeptech/logwatch-tr

## What this profile represents

This is not a portfolio of random security scripts.

This profile documents an **evidence-oriented approach** to incident analysis.

Focus:
- timeline reconstruction
- event correlation
- behavioral indicators
- root cause identification

Because most cyber incidents are not only technical problems —  
they are evidence problems.

---

## Analytical Approach

I examine:

• how an incident emerged  
• how it propagated across systems  
• which traces it left  
• why it occurred  
• how it could have been prevented

Method:
**Observe → Correlate → Interpret → Validate → Document**

---

## Professional Scope

I share technical guidance and investigative perspective.

This profile does **not** provide legal representation or official expert witness services.
